# MIT-to-Harvard-Bus-Stop-Map
#### Description:
This was a week 9 assignment that originally pulled up a street mapa nd shows you the stops between MIT and Harvard. I changed it to a satellite street map of Boston. Updated the marker to be red, since both University’s have red (crimson or cardinal) as a color.
 
#### Installation:
 
You can copy the files into the same folder on your device. Then, you drag the .html file and it into the url line. Then, click on the button to see the animation.
 
#### Usage:
 
It can help you plan a bus trip from MIT to Harvard.
 
#### Support: 
 
It doesn't really do enough to need support yet.
 
#### Roadmap: 
 
I would like to get the marker to change from a Cardinal red at MIT to a Crimson at Harvard.
